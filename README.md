# Journey :joy:
An act of travel
***the journey from youth to maturity***, ***a journey through time***
> When people say, **It's the journey, not the destination,** they mean that the significance and value of a journey is what happens along the way, from moment to moment, as opposed to the achievement of its ultimate goal.
